ZenChat is a chat app that makes talking with friends and family, or even getting 
answers from a chatbot, easy and fun. Built using Java and Firebase, it lets users send 
messages, share photos, set their status, talk over voice calls, and chat with an intelligent ChatGPT bot. The app uses Firebase for storing messages and photos, making sure that everything users do is updated in real-time and securely saved.

Creating ZenChat was all about giving users a smooth and enjoyable chatting 
experience. With voice calls, they can talk to each other directly through the app. The 
ChatGPT chatbot feature makes ZenChat even more special, providing users with a smart 
companion to chat with anytime. Whether sharing important moments with the status feature 
or just having a regular text chat, ZenChat is designed to be straightforward and fun for 
everyone.

Our goal with ZenChat was to mix the simple with the smart, providing an app where 
people can easily connect, share, and enjoy conversations, all in one place. Testing ZenChat showed that users really liked how easy it was to use and were excited about chatting with the AI bot. This feedback was a big win for us, showing that combining basic chatting features with advanced ones like ChatGPT can really enhance the chatting experience.

In the end, ZenChat is more than just a chat app; it's a new way for people to 
communicate and share, proving that even the simplest apps can be powerful and fun when 
they bring something new to the table.
